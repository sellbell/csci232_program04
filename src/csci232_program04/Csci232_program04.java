/**
 * Authors: Selene Smith, Dallas LeGrande
 * Date: 4/11/18
 *
 * Overview: 
 * - Program intended to better understand dynamic 
 *   programming and unit testing with JUnit
 *
 * - Includes a class to hold JUnit tests w/
 *   at least 4 test cases.
 *   > 1 test case to expect an exception when sent 
 *     an empty array of coins as parameter
 *
 * - Includes a class for a method with 2 parameters:
 *   1. Array of coins (US currency = 1, 5, 10, 25)
 *   2. Amount for which to make change
 *   which returns a list of coins for that amount
 *   > Throws an exception if the array of coins sent
 *     in parameter is empty
 *   > Uses dynamic programming
 * 
 * - Has no main method: execution triggered only
 *   by JUnit test cases
